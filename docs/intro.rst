What is a learning circle?
--------------------------

A Learning Circle is a study group of about 8 people that meets weekly in a physical location to complete an online course together. A facilitator is present to help with logistics and seed peer learning. Content expertise come from the online course and associated community.

For a complete guide on organizing and facilitation Learning Circles you can download the `Learning Circles facilitator handbook <https://www.p2pu.org/en/>`_.

Tools for learning circles
--------------------------

To help organize and run Learning Circles, we've developed a set of online tools. These tools are built with the assumption that you are an organization that wish to run several learnig circles.

We assume three different roles:

1. Learners. The people taking the learning circles.
1. Facilitators. People facilitating individual learnig circles.
1. Organizers. People organizing several learning circles.

For learners:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A home page listing active learning circles
* A signup form gathering basic info
* Reminders for study group meetings with an option to RSVP

For facilitators:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* A dashboard showing who signed up, when meetings are scheduled, who can come, etc.
* A messaging tool to customize weekly reminders and send extra messages
* A feedback tool to gather reflections from meetings

For organizers:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* receive feedback from facilitators on weekly meetings
* see what meetings are happening each week
* receive weekly updates on what happened in learning circles the previous week
* manage learning circles and facilitators

Using the tools
---------------

To use the tools, it will should be installed on a server you control. You need to be familiar with using the linux command line and setting up accounts on the web. You can find all the information you need to do so :doc:`here <installation>`.

If you're uncomfortable doing this on your own, or would simply prefer paying someone else to do this, you can reach out to P2PU and we can talk about setting this up for you.

You can always ask for support on `our forums <https://community.p2pu.org>`_ should you get stuck at any time.

For more information on using the tools from a facilitator or organizer perspective, you can skip over to :doc:`the facilitator user guide <facilitator>`
