Adding a new learning circle will also create the weekly meetings for the learning circle. A summary of learning circle meetings on a per week basis will be displayed on the organizer dashboard. For more information on managing weekly meetings, see the facilitator part of this guide.

Weekly update
-------------

As a facilitator you will also receive a weekly update of learning circle meetings that happened the previous week every Monday.
