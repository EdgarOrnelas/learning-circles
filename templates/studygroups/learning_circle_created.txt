Hi {{study_group.facilitator.first_name}},

Congratulations! Your Learning Circle is now live at: {{protocol}}://{{domain}}{% url 'studygroups_signup' location=study_group.venue_name|slugify study_group_id=study_group.pk %}. 

Here's what we recommend you do next to prepare for running your Learning Circle:

- Review the Facilitator Guide. Read through 40 pages of great tips, tricks, checklists, and templates to help you advertise, prepare for, and run your Learning Circle at: http://p2pu.org/facilitate

- Get in touch with other facilitators. You can ask questions, share advice, and contribute new ideas on our community forum at: https://community.p2pu.org

- Read the applications. You’ll receive an email whenever somebody applies to your Learning Circle. You can view their applications and send them messages directly through your dashboard.

You’ll hear from us again a few days before your first Learning Circle.

Cheers,
P2PU
