						<span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i></span>
						<h4>When does it start?</h4>

						<p>
							Courses begin during the week of April 27. There will be two hours of group study time each week
							in the library.
						</p>

				<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
					<div class="faq-item">
						<span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-calendar"></i></span>
						<h4>How long will it take?</h4>

						<p>
							The courses will run for between five-seven weeks. However, the pace is largely up to you. You
							can always slow down or speed up - the materials are there to be used and you can use them
							however you want.

						<span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></span>
						<h4>How will this all go down?</h4>

						<p>
							Every week you’ll join your study group for a meeting of minds (and regular high fives) in your
							local library branch. You’ll be guided through the online materials by a community organiser,
							who will help facilitate collaboration with your fellow learners.

						<h4>What will I learn?</h4>

						<p>
                            Each course has been selected in the hope that it is interesting and relevant to you and the people in your study group. As well as the informational content, we’ve designed the course time so that participants gain experience giving and receiving feedback feedback, working in groups, and feeling comfortable working online.

						<h4>What do I need to bring?</h4>

						<p>
							All you need is a few hours per week in your library branch and a thirst for knowledge. The
							library will provide computers, and all necessary course materials.

				<div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6">
					<div class="faq-item">
						<span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-question"></i></span>
						<h4>Why should I take a course?</h4>

						<p>
							Why not? Sure, each course will teach you a new skill, but even more exciting is the chance to
							join with other people from your community and learn something new together in the library. We
							believe that learning can, and should, be fun, and we hope that you will join us. You’ll receive
							a certificate from P2PU and CPL at the end of the course.
