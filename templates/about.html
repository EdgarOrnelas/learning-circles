Learning Circles are peer supported, facilitated by non-content experts, hosted in publicly accessible spaces, designed to be taken with few prerequisites, and free for learners. You can think of Learning Circles like a book group for learning." %}</p> 
         
            <p class="about-body">{% trans "Generally, Learning Circles meet for 90 minutes a week in a public space (like a library) for 6 to 8 weeks. Each Learning Circle has a facilitator. He or she is not necessarily a content expert, but has been trained in helping support a peer learning environment for learners like you who want to work through online courses together." %}</p> 
         
            <p class="about-body">{% trans "Learning Circles offer much more than a dedicated weekly study time and space. Past participants have commented on the value of working through material with peers, gaining access to new study strategies, finding a support group of like minded individuals, and learning at one's own pace in low pressure environment." %}</p>
